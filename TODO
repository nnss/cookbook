User solved using:
http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch

Feature list:
-> added details in user page (and also his/her recipes)
-> will paginate impelemted
-> recaptcha implemented



TODO:
 -> pending admin review on user creation (perhaps using workflow)
 -> Groups
    -> probably the best is to modify the user model adding grup_id (user has_one group)
 -> search by ingredient (or multiple ingredients)
    -> it would be great to have a flag and search only for recipes with
       the given ingredients (and avoid other recipes with extra ingredients)
 -> global search
 -> hide modifications links (edit/create/...) for anonymous users
 Recipe model modifcations:
   -> add dish type (dissert, main dish, side dish, etc)
   this should be an enumerat (user could select only one option)

 General Layout:
  -> add last (1 or more) recipe(s) like the random recipe
  -> modify general index to have something like:
  |-----------------------------------|
  | <Recipe Name>             <yield> |
  |                                   |
  | <instrtuctions>...Read more       |
  |                                   |
  |-----------------------------------|

    -> This should be repeted in N columns by M rows (dinamic)


fixed:
  tag window: now appears all the tags
  user link: now the user goes to /users/name and in that page appears name and recipes
