http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch

    -> users in recipes links to all the recipes for that user
-> will paginate impelemted
-> recaptcha implemented
-> recipes has tags
-> menu column hast random recipe and last 3 recipes
-> articles has tags


TODO:

 MultiLang:
   -> Add language/lang to the recipe
   -> Comments and ingredients should be raw (as the "owner" of them are the recipes)
   -> make a lang global var

 Edit policies:
   -> pending admin review on user creation (perhaps using workflow)
     -> should be added a pending review or somethig to avoid being seen in
        the general index (if groups review is implemented)
   -> Groups
     -> Default is null as a group
     -> admin user should be able to add other users

 Search:
   -> advanced search by ingredient (or multiple ingredients)
      -> it would be great to have a flag and search only for recipes with
       the given ingredients (and avoid other recipes with extra ingredients)
   -> global search
   Options:
    * https://github.com/dougal/acts_as_indexed
    * https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/rails_search


 General Layout:
 -> In a determined place should be a "related article" to the current recipe
    -> linked by tags, if not, just any random
