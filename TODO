User solved using:
http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch

Feature list:
-> added details in user page (and also his/her recipes)
-> will paginate impelemted
-> recaptcha implemented



TODO:
 -> pending admin review on user creation (perhaps using workflow)
 -> Groups
    -> probably the best is to modify the user model adding grup_id (user has_one group)
 -> advanced search by ingredient (or multiple ingredients)
    -> it would be great to have a flag and search only for recipes with
       the given ingredients (and avoid other recipes with extra ingredients)
 -> global search
 -> hide modifications links (edit/create/...) for anonymous users
 Recipe model modifcations:
 -> should be added a pending review or somethig to avoid being seen in
    the general index (if groups review is implemented)

 General Layout:
  -> add last (1 or more) recipe(s) like the random recipe
    -> This should be repeted in N columns by M rows (dinamic)
